# Full disk encryption for Kali on Raspberry (or other similar architecture) using LUKS

dont take 100% the same but mostly same commands will work, change where need

This HOWTO is dedicated to running [Kali](https://www.kali.org/)
on [Raspberry](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) (or other similar architecture,
e.g. [ODROID-C2](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G145457216438)
using full disk encryption with [LUKS](https://guardianproject.info/code/luks/).
Based on the little bit outdated document
[here](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux/raspberry-pi-luks-disk-encryption/).

## Motivation

Deploying Kali on Raspberry Pi (or other similar, small, low-powered hardware)
in a LAN environment as a "throw-away-hackbox" is obviously useful. However,
keeping the collected data in secret is an
essential requirement. Here comes full disk encryption as a mandatory
security concept.

## Prerequisites

First we should
[setup](http://docs.kali.org/kali-on-arm/install-kali-linux-arm-raspberry-pi)
an official current Kali image for the Raspberry Pi (without encryption)
on an SD card.

The recommended option (now) is using a Raspberry Pi 3 custom build
with the [nexmon patch](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon)
(for using the onboard WiFi monitoring and injecting capabilities).
There is an automated build script in the official
[kali-arm-build-scripts](https://github.com/offensive-security/kali-arm-build-scripts)
repo which sets up the image from scratch (on a Kali distro).
And here is a
[patched version](https://github.com/tothi/kali-arm-build-scripts)
which works on other distros than Kali, too (tested on
[Gentoo](https://gentoo.org/)). Currently (2017-08) working build
script for ODROID-C2 is also here in that forked repo.

Get the build tools and build the image from scratch
as root (it can take couple of hours):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tothi/kali-arm-build-scripts
$ cd kali-arm-build-scripts
$ sudo ./rpi3-nexmon.sh 2.0
```

The resulting image is `rpi3-nexmon-2.0/kali-2.0-rpi3-nexmon.img.xz`.
Copy it on SD card (using pv for displaying progress):
```
# pixz -d rpi3-nexmon-2.0/kali-2.0-rpi3-nexmon.img.xz - | pv -treb | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=512k
```

(The image should work, it can be tested now.)

## Preparing the RPi image for encrypted boot

We mount the image from the SD card and prepare an initramfs
capable with LUKS features in a chroot environment. For making
this work, an x86 (host) `qemu-arm-static` binary is needed
on the SD card filesystem. The above patched `rpi3-nexmon.sh`
build script installs and leaves it on the image, so things
should work well. (Otherwise copying the appropriate qemu
static binary to the image is needed.)

Initializing the chroot environment (on the host system as root):
```
# mkdir -p /mnt/chroot/boot
# mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt/chroot/
# mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/chroot/boot/

# mount -t proc none /mnt/chroot/proc
# mount -t sysfs none /mnt/chroot/sys
# mount -o bind /dev /mnt/chroot/dev
# mount -o bind /dev/pts /mnt/chroot/dev/pts

# LANG=C chroot /mnt/chroot/
```
At first we change the default password for root:
```
passwd
```
Install required packages (in the chroot env):
```
# apt-get update
# apt-get install busybox cryptsetup dropbear
```

Note, that we have to enter the decryption key on
every boot. We do it preferably remotely through SSH,
that's why `dropbear` is needed (in the initramfs).

Now edit `/boot/cmdline.txt`, change root device to
the mapped crypt device (`/dev/mapper/crypt_sdcard`)
and add the appropriate `cryptdevice` parameter.

So here is an original `/boot/cmdline.txt`:
```
dwc_otg.fiq_fix_enable=2 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait rootflags=noload net.ifnames=0
```

And here is the updated one (differences in `root` and `cryptdevice` params):
```
dwc_otg.fiq_fix_enable=2 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mapper/crypt_sdcard cryptdevice=/dev/mmcblk0p2:crypt_sdcard rootfstype=ext4 rootwait rootflags=noload net.ifnames=0
```

Now create `/boot/config.txt` with the following content:
```
initramfs initramfs.gz followkernel
```

Note that on other hardware a similar steps are needed
(the file containing the boot params on ODROID-C2 is
`/boot/boot.ini`).

Let's set up Dropbear SSH key authentication.
Create a (passwordless) keypair on the host machine (outside chroot!)
and read the public key:
```
$ ssh-keygen -N "" -f kali-dropbear
$ cat ./kali-dropbear.pub
```

Add the public key to `/etc/dropbear-initramfs/authorized_keys`.
Restrict Dropbear SSH access for setting up cryptroot only
by prepending the key with this:
```
command="/scripts/local-top/cryptroot && kill -9 `ps | grep -m 1 'cryptroot' | cut -d ' ' -f 3`"
```

Fix permissions:
```
chmod 600 /etc/dropbear-initramfs/authorized_keys
```

Edit `/etc/fstab`. Original:
```
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
proc            /proc           proc    defaults          0       0
/dev/mmcblk0p1  /boot           vfat    defaults          0       2
/dev/mmcblk0p2  /               ext4    defaults,noatime  0       1
```

Updated `/` device changed to `/dev/mapper/crypt_sdcard`:
```
# <file system>           <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
proc                      /proc           proc    defaults          0       0
/dev/mmcblk0p1            /boot           vfat    defaults          0       2
/dev/mapper/crypt_sdcard  /               ext4    defaults,noatime  0       1
```

Add this line to `/etc/crypttab`:
```
crypt_sdcard /dev/mmcblk0p2 none luks
```

Modify `/etc/cryptsetup-initramfs/conf-hook` by setting
```
CRYPTSETUP=y
```
to include `cryptsetup` files in initramfs image.

Finally, make initramfs for the current kernel version
and leave chroot (don't bother with errors/warnings during mkinitramfs):
```
# ls -l /lib/modules/ |awk -F" " '{print $9}'

4.4.50-v7+
# mkinitramfs -o /boot/initramfs.gz 4.4.50-v7+
```

Note, that we have to be careful when generating the image
(especially on other hardware), because
`uname -r` returns the host kernel version, not the chroot one.
So e.g. on ODROID-C2 `/boot/mkuinitrd` does not work out of
the box, we should issue the commands in the script manually
(adjusting the kernel version FOR OTHER HARDWARE!):
```
# rm /boot/initrd.img-3.14.79
# update-initramfs -c -k 3.14.79
# mkimage -A arm64 -O linux -T ramdisk -C none -a 0 -e 0 -n "uInitrd" -d /boot/initrd.img-3.14.79 /boot/uInitrd
#
```

Exit chroot environment
```
exit
```
Unmount filesystems and backup rootfs before creating encrypted
volume (and deleting everything) on SD card:
```
# umount /mnt/chroot/boot
# umount /mnt/chroot/sys
# umount /mnt/chroot/proc
# mkdir -p /mnt/backup
# rsync -avh /mnt/chroot/* /mnt/backup/
```

Unmount the full chroot:
```
# umount /mnt/chroot/dev/pts
# umount /mnt/chroot/dev
# umount /mnt/chroot
```

Delete unencrypted root partition (num. 2) and create an empty one
(fulfilling the SD card):
```
# echo -e "d\n2\nw" | fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
# echo -e "n\np\n2\n\n\nw" | fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
```

Now (probably) unplugging and inserting the SD card is needed
in order to register the new partitions.

Create encrypted volume with a strong passphrase
(this step destroys the original rootfs!):
```
# cryptsetup -v -y --cipher aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 --key-size 256 luksFormat /dev/mmcblk0p2
# cryptsetup -v luksOpen /dev/mmcblk0p2 crypt_sdcard
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/crypt_sdcard
```

Restore rootfs to the encrypted volume and close the disk:
```
# mkdir -p /mnt/encrypted
# mount /dev/mapper/crypt_sdcard /mnt/encrypted/
# rsync -avh /mnt/backup/* /mnt/encrypted/
# umount /mnt/encrypted/
# cryptsetup luksClose /dev/mapper/crypt_sdcard
# sync
```
Eject SD card and test it on the Raspberry. 

## Boot the device

The first boot process will fail und fallback into busybox. Enter the following commands:
```
# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/mmcblk0p2 crypt_sdcard
## provide password
# exit
```
Your device should boot now. Login with the password you've chosen earlier and run:
```
mkinitramfs -o /boot/initramfs.gz
reboot
```
You will be asked for passphrase now with a nicer prompt, furthermore you should be able to ssh to the busybox and enter the passphrase
(you may use a custom `known_hosts` file if you wish):
```
$ ssh -o "UserKnownHostsFile=~/.ssh/known_hosts.initramfs" -i ~/.ssh/kali-dropbear root@192.168.88.133
```

Once it is working, do not forget to clean up backup files on the host:
```
# rm -fr /mnt/backup
# rm -fr /mnt/chroot
```

## Trouble shooting
To get full debug output during boot you can add `debug=1` in cmdline.txt
